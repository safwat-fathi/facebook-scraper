# Recommendations from AI

## Prompt

- **you are a web developer with 10 years experience of building web scrapers using nodejs, typescript and puppeteer, what you can provide me to build a facebook scraper to find**:

	- scalable application architecture  
	- no coupled code
	- pages with certain titles and categories
	- collect these data and store it
	- message the found pages/ accounts later 
	-	run tasks with a controlled schedule 
	- any other helpful feature or advice would be appreciated 

## Scalable Architecture

- Microservices: Break down the scraping process into smaller, independent services:
- Scraper Service: Handles puppeteer browser interaction and data extraction.
- Filter Service: Filters results based on titles and categories.
- Storage Service: Stores scraped data in a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL).
- Messaging Service: Sends messages to found pages/accounts (consider ethical and legal implications).
- Scheduler Service: Schedules tasks with controlled intervals using a library like node-cron or a cloud scheduling service.
- Containerization: Use Docker containers to package each microservice for independent deployment and scaling.
- Message Queue (Optional): Implement a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for asynchronous communication between services to handle high traffic or complex workflows.

## Decoupled Code

- Clear Interfaces: Define clear interfaces for communication between services. This promotes loose coupling and easier maintenance.
- Dependency Injection: Use dependency injection to inject dependencies (e.g., database connection) into services. This allows for easier testing and mocking.

## Data Scraping and Storage

- Data Validation: Implement data validation before storage to ensure data integrity.
- Error Handling: Handle potential errors gracefully during scraping and storage operations.
- Database Selection: Choose a database that fits your needs (relational for structured data, NoSQL for flexible data).

## Messaging (Consider Legality and Ethics)

- Facebook Guidelines: Be mindful of Facebook's terms of service regarding scraping and messaging. Sending automated messages might be considered spam. Explore ethical alternatives.
- Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to avoid overwhelming Facebook's servers with requests.
- Messaging Platform (Optional): Consider using a separate messaging platform instead of directly messaging Facebook accounts (e.g., email marketing services).

## Scheduled Tasks

- Node-cron Library: Use node-cron or similar libraries to schedule tasks at regular intervals (e.g., hourly, daily).
- Cloud Scheduling Services: Explore cloud services like AWS CloudWatch Scheduler or Google Cloud Scheduler for managed task scheduling.

## Helpful Features and Advice

- Headless Browsing: Use Puppeteer's headless mode for faster scraping without a visible browser window.
- Proxy Rotation (Optional): Consider rotating proxies to avoid IP blocking by Facebook. Use this ethically and responsibly.
- Logging and Monitoring: Implement logging to track scraping activity and errors. Set up monitoring tools for service health.
Ethical Considerations: Always prioritize user privacy and respect Facebook's terms of service. This scraper is intended for educational purposes only.
- Rate limiting to avoid Facebook blocking
- Health checking of services
- Logging and metrics
- Configuration using environment variables
- Containerization using Docker

## Remember

- Scraping Facebook without explicit consent or for malicious purposes is unethical and might violate their terms of service.
- Focus on ethical data collection practices and consider alternatives to scraping user data directly from Facebook.
- This information equips you to build a robust and scalable scraper architecture. Adapt it based on your specific requirements and prioritize ethical data collection practices.
